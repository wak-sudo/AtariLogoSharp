== User Manual ==

If you want to hide the input box, click on the draw screen.
If you want to restore the input box, press Escape.

=== Basic commands ===

CS - remove drawings / clean up the board.
HT - hide the turtle icon.
ST - show the turtle icon.
RT angle - turn the turtle by the specified angle (in degrees) to the right.
LT angle - turn the turtle by the specified angle (in degrees) to the left.
FD steps - move the turtle forward by the given number of steps.
PU - the moving turtle does not leave a trace.
PD - the moving turtle leaves a trace
BK steps - move the turtle backwards by the given number of steps.

REPEAT x [abc] - repeat the instruction abc in square brackets x times
e.g. REPEAT 4 [FD 50 LT 90] draws a square.

=== Turtles commands ===

TELL turtleID - or to select multiple - TELL [ turtleID1 turtleID2, ...]
- a new turtle appears (the first one has index 0), 
all commands appearing after the TELL command apply to the called turtle until the next TELL call.
e.g. TELL [ 0 1 ]

ASK [ turtleID ... ] [ code ]
- executes specific orders for specific turtles.
e.g. ASK [ 0 1 ] [ FD 100 ]

EACH [ code ] - executes specific orders for all turtles created (even for the inactive).

==== Color commands ====

Evey turtle has 3 pens avaiable (numbered from 0 to 2).
There are 128 colors available from the Atari pallet (numbered from 0 to 127).

SETC colorID - change the color of the current turtle to the selected one.
SETPN penID - change the active pen of the turtle.
SETPC penID colorID - change the color of the selected pen of the turtle.

Commands can be combined freely.

=== Procedures ===

Procedures are collections of commands that you can invoke with their names. 
Adding parameters is also available.

==== Define ====

Syntax looks like this:

TO name parameters code END 

Parameters represent numbers, each parameter name starts with ':'

Examples:
TO STAR REPEAT 5 [ FD 100 RT 144 ] END
TO SQUARE :LENGTH REPEAT 4 [ FD :LENGTH RT 90 ] END
TO HYPOTROCHOID REPEAT 20 [ REPEAT 180 [ FD 1 RT 2] RT 18] HT END

==== Invoke ====

To invoke the procedure, type its name and provide the required number of parameters.

Examples:
STAR
SQUARE 100
HYPOTROCHOID

==== Edit & View & Delete =====

To remove all procedures, type:

ERALL

To view procedures memorized by the program, type:

POTS

To edit the procedure or procedures, type:

ED procedureName
or to select multiple:
ED [ procedureName1 procedureName2 ...]

e.g.:
ED STAR
ED [ STAR SQUARE ]

The code of the procedure/procedures will appear in the input box.
You can change it freely, as long the name remains unchanged.
If the procedure name is changed, the code will be treated as an entirely new procedure.

=== Save & Load ===

You can save and load your procedures from a local file.

Type:

SAVE filePath - to save your procedures to a selected file.
LOAD filePath - to load your procedures from a selected file.

e.g.:
SAVE procedures.logo
LOAD procedures.logo

	REMEMBER:
1. The file path cannot contain spaces
(same as in the original Atari Logo implementation).
2. You are able to save directly to protected folders (e.g. C: drive root) only 
if the application is run with administrative privileges.
